+# CoachCW Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### I. User Outcomes First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
+Every initiative must anchor to explicit user journeys and measurable success criteria before
+design or build. Prioritize by user value (P1, P2, P3) and keep acceptance criteria testable and
+observable so progress can be demonstrated quickly.
+
+### II. Test-First Reliability
+Write failing tests before implementing new behaviors (unit, contract, integration as needed).
+Code may not merge without passing automated tests covering acceptance criteria and critical
+failure paths. Regression tests must be added alongside any bug fix.
+
+### III. Incremental, Releasable Slices
+Work is broken into independently valuable slices that can ship on their own. Avoid cross-story
+coupling; favor feature flags or configuration to keep incomplete work disabled while keeping the
+main branch releasable at all times.
+
+### IV. Text-First Interfaces & Traceability
+Automation and tooling favor text I/O (stdin/stdout/stderr) with deterministic, parseable output
+to enable scripting, debugging, and reproducibility. All commands and scripts must emit structured
+logs for traceability.
+
+### V. Observability & Change Safety
+Changes must include meaningful logging, error handling, and (where applicable) metrics that expose
+health and user impact. Dependencies are pinned, secrets are excluded from the repo, and every
+change includes a rollback or disable strategy.
+
+## Quality & Security Standards
+
+- Pin runtime, tooling, and dependency versions in manifests or lockfiles; document any deviations.
+- Keep secrets, keys, and sensitive data out of source control; use environment configuration with
+clear setup instructions.
+- Document decisions that affect user value, risk, or maintainability in feature plans/specs.
+- Keep architecture as small as possible for the requirement; justify additional components in
+plans with simpler alternatives considered.
+- Data handling must state retention, access, and error-handling expectations in specs when user
+data is involved.
+
+## Workflow & Delivery Process
+
+- Constitution Check happens in every plan: confirm user outcomes, test-first approach, incremental
+slices, text-first interfaces, and observability commitments before research/implementation.
+- Delivery flow: plan → spec → tasks → implementation. Each stage must carry forward priorities,
+acceptance criteria, and test strategy; tasks remain grouped by user story to preserve independent
+delivery.
+- Reviews and releases must verify tests are present and passing, logs/metrics are covered for new
+paths, and any feature flags or rollback instructions are documented.
+
+## Governance
+
+- This constitution supersedes other practice docs; deviations require explicit risk acceptance in
+the relevant plan/spec and reviewer approval.
+- Amendments require a documented change proposal (PR) describing rationale, expected impacts, and
+any migration steps; approvals must include at least one maintainer.
+- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for incompatible governance/principle changes, MINOR for
+new principles/sections or materially stronger requirements, PATCH for clarifications.
+- Compliance is reviewed at plan creation and before release; any violation must list mitigations
+and timelines for resolution.

+
+# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]
+
+**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
+**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
+
+**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED for any new behavior. Include contract, integration, and unit coverage that proves acceptance criteria for each story before implementation.
+
+**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Keep stories independently releasable; avoid cross-story coupling unless documented as a dependency.
+
+## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
+
+- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
+- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
+- Include exact file paths in descriptions
+
+## Path Conventions
+
+- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
+- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
+- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
+- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure
+
+<!-- 
+  ============================================================================
+  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
+  
+  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
+  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
+  - Feature requirements from plan.md
+  - Entities from data-model.md
+  - Endpoints from contracts/
+  
+  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
+  - Implemented independently
+  - Tested independently
+  - Delivered as an MVP increment
+  
+  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
+  ============================================================================
+-->
+
+## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)
+
+**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure
+
+- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
+- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
+- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools
+
+---
+
+## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)
+
+**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented
+
+**CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete
+
+Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):
+
+- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
+- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
+- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
+- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
+- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
+- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management
+
+**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel
+
+---
+
+## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) MVP
+
+**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
+
+**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
+
+### Tests for User Story 1 (mandatory)
+
+> Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation
+
+- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
+- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
+
+### Implementation for User Story 1
+
+- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
+- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
+- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
+- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
+- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
+- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations
+
+**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently
+
+---
+
+## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)
+
+**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
+
+**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
+
+### Tests for User Story 2 (mandatory)
+
+- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
+- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
+
+### Implementation for User Story 2
+
+- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
+- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
+- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
+- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)
+
+**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently
+
+---
+
+## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)
+
+**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
+
+**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
+
+### Tests for User Story 3 (mandatory)
+
+- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
+- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
+
+### Implementation for User Story 3
+
+- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
+- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
+- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
+
+**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional
+
+---
+
+[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]
+
+---
+
+## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
+
+**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories
+
+- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
+- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
+- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
+- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests in tests/unit/
+- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
+- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation
+
+---
+
+## Dependencies & Execution Order
+
+### Phase Dependencies
+
+- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
+- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
+- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
+  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
+  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
+- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
+
+### User Story Dependencies
+
+- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
+- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
+- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
+
+### Within Each User Story
+
+- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
+- Models before services
+- Services before endpoints
+- Core implementation before integration
+- Story complete before moving to next priority
+
+### Parallel Opportunities
+
+- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
+- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
+- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
+- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
+- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
+- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
+
+---
+
+## Parallel Example: User Story 1
+
+```bash

+## Implementation Strategy
+
+### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
+
+1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
+2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
+3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
+4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
+5. Deploy/demo if ready
+
+### Incremental Delivery
+
+1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
+2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
+3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
+4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
+5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories
+
+### Parallel Team Strategy
+
+With multiple developers:
+
+1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
+2. Once Foundational is done:
+   - Developer A: User Story 1
+   - Developer B: User Story 2
+   - Developer C: User Story 3
+3. Stories complete and integrate independently

+# CoachCW Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### I. User Outcomes First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
+Every initiative must anchor to explicit user journeys and measurable success criteria before
+design or build. Prioritize by user value (P1, P2, P3) and keep acceptance criteria testable and
+observable so progress can be demonstrated quickly.
+
+### II. Test-First Reliability
+Write failing tests before implementing new behaviors (unit, contract, integration as needed).
+Code may not merge without passing automated tests covering acceptance criteria and critical
+failure paths. Regression tests must be added alongside any bug fix.
+
+### III. Incremental, Releasable Slices
+Work is broken into independently valuable slices that can ship on their own. Avoid cross-story
+coupling; favor feature flags or configuration to keep incomplete work disabled while keeping the
+main branch releasable at all times.
+
+### IV. Text-First Interfaces & Traceability
+Automation and tooling favor text I/O (stdin/stdout/stderr) with deterministic, parseable output
+to enable scripting, debugging, and reproducibility. All commands and scripts must emit structured
+logs for traceability.
+
+### V. Observability & Change Safety
+Changes must include meaningful logging, error handling, and (where applicable) metrics that expose
+health and user impact. Dependencies are pinned, secrets are excluded from the repo, and every
+change includes a rollback or disable strategy.
+
+## Quality & Security Standards
+
+- Pin runtime, tooling, and dependency versions in manifests or lockfiles; document any deviations.
+- Keep secrets, keys, and sensitive data out of source control; use environment configuration with
+clear setup instructions.
+- Document decisions that affect user value, risk, or maintainability in feature plans/specs.
+- Keep architecture as small as possible for the requirement; justify additional components in
+plans with simpler alternatives considered.
+- Data handling must state retention, access, and error-handling expectations in specs when user
+data is involved.
+
+## Workflow & Delivery Process
+
+- Constitution Check happens in every plan: confirm user outcomes, test-first approach, incremental
+slices, text-first interfaces, and observability commitments before research/implementation.
+- Delivery flow: plan -> spec -> tasks -> implementation. Each stage must carry forward priorities,
+acceptance criteria, and test strategy; tasks remain grouped by user story to preserve independent
+delivery.
+- Reviews and releases must verify tests are present and passing, logs/metrics are covered for new
+paths, and any feature flags or rollback instructions are documented.
+
+## Governance
+
+- This constitution supersedes other practice docs; deviations require explicit risk acceptance in
+the relevant plan/spec and reviewer approval.
+- Amendments require a documented change proposal (PR) describing rationale, expected impacts, and
+any migration steps; approvals must include at least one maintainer.
+- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for incompatible governance/principle changes, MINOR for
+new principles/sections or materially stronger requirements, PATCH for clarifications.
+- Compliance is reviewed at plan creation and before release; any violation must list mitigations
+and timelines for resolution.

+
+# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]
+
+**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
+**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
+
+**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED for any new behavior. Include contract, integration, and unit coverage that proves acceptance criteria for each story before implementation.
+
+**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story. Keep stories independently releasable; avoid cross-story coupling unless documented as a dependency.
+
+## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
+
+- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
+- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
+- Include exact file paths in descriptions
+
+## Path Conventions
+
+- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
+- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
+- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
+- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure
+
+<!-- 
+  ============================================================================
+  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
+  
+  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
+  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
+  - Feature requirements from plan.md
+  - Entities from data-model.md
+  - Endpoints from contracts/
+  
+  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
+  - Implemented independently
+  - Tested independently
+  - Delivered as an MVP increment
+  
+  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
+  ============================================================================
+-->
+
+## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)
+
+**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure
+
+- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
+- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
+- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools
+
+---
+
+## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)
+
+**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented
+
+**CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete
+
+Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):
+
+- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
+- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
+- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
+- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
+- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
+- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management
+
+**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel
+
+---
+
+## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) MVP
+
+**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
+
+**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
+
+### Tests for User Story 1 (mandatory)
+
+> Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation
+
+- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
+- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
+
+### Implementation for User Story 1
+
+- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
+- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
+- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
+- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
+- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
+- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations
+
+**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently
+
+---
+
+## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)
+
+**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
+
+**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
+
+### Tests for User Story 2 (mandatory)
+
+- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
+- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
+
+### Implementation for User Story 2
+
+- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
+- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
+- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
+- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)
+
+**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently
+
+---
+
+## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)
+
+**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]
+
+**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]
+
+### Tests for User Story 3 (mandatory)
+
+- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
+- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py
+
+### Implementation for User Story 3
+
+- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
+- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
+- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
+
+**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional
+
+---
+
+[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]
+
+---
+
+## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
+
+**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories
+
+- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
+- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
+- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
+- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests in tests/unit/
+- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
+- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation
+
+---
+
+## Dependencies & Execution Order
+
+### Phase Dependencies
+
+- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
+- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
+- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
+  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
+  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 -> P2 -> P3)
+- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete
+
+### User Story Dependencies
+
+- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
+- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
+- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
+
+### Within Each User Story
+
+- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
+- Models before services
+- Services before endpoints
+- Core implementation before integration
+- Story complete before moving to next priority
+
+### Parallel Opportunities
+
+- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
+- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
+- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
+- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
+- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
+- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
+
+---
+
+## Parallel Example: User Story 1
+
+```bash
+# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
+Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
+Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"
+
+# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
+Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
+Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
+```
+
+---
+
+## Implementation Strategy
+
+### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
+
+1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
+2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
+3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
+4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
+5. Deploy/demo if ready

+
+- User outcomes are explicit, prioritized (P1/P2/P3), and measurable.
+- Tests are defined first: list required unit/contract/integration coverage per story before build.
+- Work is sliced into independently releasable increments; avoid cross-story coupling.
+- Interfaces and tooling use text-first I/O with deterministic, parseable outputs and structured logs.
+- Observability and change safety are planned: logging, metrics (if applicable), dependency pinning,
+  and rollback/flag strategy are identified.
